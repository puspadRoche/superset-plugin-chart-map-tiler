### Why this version
- Uses emoji headers (`✨`, `🚀`, etc.) → visually separates sections (looks great on GitHub & Medium).  
- Keeps the shell code block under triple backticks so it’s formatted as code, not shown literally.  
- Puts the screenshot HTML **outside** the code block — so the image will actually render.
